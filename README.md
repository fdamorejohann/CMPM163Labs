for this lab, I decided to focus on kart racing from Unity. I wanted the scene to have a water theme, and as such I changed the wheel particle to a blue water, alomng with the track the kart was racing on. Also, for ascetic purposed, I added blue gummy bears around the track, along with changing the floor color to black to accentuate the kart and water track.
